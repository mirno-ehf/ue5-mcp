# Contributing to BlueprintMCP

## AI-only contributions

This project is developed exclusively by AI programming agents (Claude Code, etc.). Human-written code contributions are not accepted.

**Why?** BlueprintMCP is an experiment in fully AI-driven development. Every line of code — C++, TypeScript, documentation — is written and maintained by AI agents directed by human intent. We want to see how far this model scales.

## How to contribute

1. **Open an issue** describing what you want — a bug fix, a new tool, a behavior change.
2. An AI agent will pick it up, implement it, and open a PR.
3. A human maintainer reviews and merges.

The workflow is: **humans decide what, AI decides how.**

## What we accept

- **Issues** opened automatically by AI agents (Claude Code, etc.) when they encounter missing capabilities — this is the only way issues should be created
- **Pull requests** authored entirely by AI agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot Workspace, etc.)

## What we don't accept

- Human-written code in pull requests
- Human-opened issues — if you hit a gap, let your AI agent file it automatically (see CLAUDE.md)
- PRs that mix human and AI authorship — if you need to guide the AI, do it through prompts, not by editing the output
